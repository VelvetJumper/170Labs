<text>You are in charge of writing a program for a charity fund. At a certain store, customers are allowed to round up their purchase price to a prodcut of 10 and an integer and donate the extra change to charity. Write a method money(double cost) that displays a message. This message state what the customer's original cost was, what the system rounded it up to, and how much of their final cost is being donated. Nothing in the store costs more than $49.99, so do not worry about making a case for any final cost that is greater than $50.
