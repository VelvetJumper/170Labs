<text>You are in a class which requires turning in weekly papers. If your grade is below a certain number, you allowed a certain number of peer reviews before you resubmit your paper for a new grade. Write a program with the method notification(double grade). Using if and if else loops, create responses that are generated when inputing different given grades.
